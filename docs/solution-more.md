Each of the following solutions has been proven to be effective and we hope to be helpful to you.

## Domain binding

The precondition for **Domain binding** is have completed the **Domain resolution** for Zabbix Instance.

From the perspective of server security and subsequent maintenance considerations, the **Domain Binding** step cannot be omitted.

Zabbix domain name binding steps:

1. Connect your Cloud Server
2. Modify [vhost configuration file](/stack-components.md#apache), change the domain name item for you
   ```text
     <VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName zabbix.mydomain.com # modify it for you
   ```
3. Save it and restart [Web Service](/admin-services.md#apache)


## Zabbix language

After implementation of Gettext for Zabbix 2.0 the locales of used languages have to be installed on web server. Some operating systems have installed almost all locales by default (for instance CentOS, FreeBSD).

Following is the steps for you to enable Chinese language:

1. Connect to Zabbix's server, run one of these command
   ```
   ##command one (Suggestion)
   locale-gen zh_CN.UTF-8

   ##command two
   dpkg-reconfigure locales
   ```

   If you use the **command two**, please refer the pictures below, selectd **zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8** locale(Keyboard space bar selected, Tab key to switch position)
